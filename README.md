# FsDNN - Deep Neural Network Library

## Purpose

- Reimplement material from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) in F# to gain deeper understanding.
- Build a generic .NET Core DNN library for other projects.

## Library design

- TBD

## Features

### Core

- [x] Written in F#/.NET Core 3 using [Math.NET Numerics on MKL](https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/)
- [x] Componentized - each of the aspects below can be tested and extended on it own
- [x] Entirely Test Driven Developed
- [x] Static Computation Graph
- [x] Tensor abstraction (Uniform API for Matrix/Vector with minimal broadcasting support)
- [x] Minimal transfer learning
- [ ] Gradient checking

### Initializations

- [x] He

### Activations: 

- [x] Linear
- [x] Sigmoid
- [x] ReLU
- [ ] TanH

### Cost Functions

- [x] Mean squared error
- [x] Binary Cross entropy with logits
- [x] Categorical Cross entropy with logits

### Optimization

- [x] Batch Gradient Descent
- [ ] Stochastic/Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
- [x] Momentum
- [x] AdaM

### Regularization

- [ ] L2
- [ ] Dropout

### Demos

- [ ] MNIST
- [ ] ?Multilabel?
- [ ] ?Regression?

## Performance

TBD - compare with numpy

## Future Ideas

- [ ] Implment Tensor functions on GPU
- [ ] Implement CNN and RNN class networks based on the Computation Graph
- [ ] Enable dynamic version of  the Computation Graph

## TODO

- Refactoring
  - optimize matrix operations in tensor layer
  - Remove Tensor R0: lr should not be a tensor
  - Pull optimization out of trainer
